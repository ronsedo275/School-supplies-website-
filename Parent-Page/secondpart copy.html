Teachers will have the opportunity to see and hear how these changes are occurring and distinguish the impacts that are being made in the Pontchartrain Basin (PB). Because the majority of the PB is being directly impacted by rising sea levels, natural events, and other impacts of climate change, this workshop will explore areas that have been impacted the most by climate change. This region is not only seeing changes physically, but they are experiencing changes in their livelihood. Homes that were once protected from rising waters are not flooding. Workers who depend on the wetlands and the ecosystem have difficulty providing for their families. Farmers in low-lying areas face drainage issues that were not prevalent in previous years. These changes place governmental agencies on high alert for the next potential disaster and create new ways to preserve their communities. This professional development aims to increase awareness about climate change implications for Louisiana and help teachers strategize effective activities that foster a stewardship ethos. We will explore the positive and negative influences humans exert on the environment.\r\n\r\nThroughout this professional development, K-12 science and social studies teachers who work directly with English Learners (ELs) will be provided with strategies to help improve EL academic language in their subject, provide best teaching practices for ELs, and provide valuable hands-on learning to make the information relevant to students. Teachers will examine how cultural differences can impact a student\u2019s education and how to meet these needs. EL specialists will demonstrate to teachers how to use EL strategies and create lesson plans to meet the need of EL students. The specialists will bring their knowledge of language acquisition, effective EL strategies, and their classroom expertise in teaching EL students.\r\n\r\nThis is a two-year professional development opportunity.
